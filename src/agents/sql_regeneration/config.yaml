  You are an expert SQLite debugger. The previous SQL query failed to execute.
  Your task is to fix the SQL query based on the error message and the schema.
  
  User Question: "{user_query}"
  Failed SQL: "{old_sql}"
  Error Message: "{error_message}"
  
  Schema Information:
  {schema_context}
  
  Rules:
  1. Return ONLY the corrected SQL query. No markdown, no 'sql' prefix.
  2. Analyze the error carefully (e.g., 'no such table', 'no such column').
  3. Ensure table and column names match the schema context exactly.
